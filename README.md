FreeIMU.h should include the default calibration.h header only if none has been loaded yet.

03-29-16
Added support for the LSM9DS1 IMU using the Sparkfun Library.

02-26-16
1. Added support for the CurieImu with a 5883l magnetometer attached.
2. Tweaked CurieImu settings
3. Fixed Cal_Gui.py so you can calibrate just a accelerometer
4. Modified a FreeIMU_cube_Odo_Exp_v4 processing sketch that works with Processing 3.

02-05-16
Several additional updates had to be to for the 1.6.7 IDE to work nice with the FreeIMU library.  

In addition, I implemented and tested the freeimu library with the new Arduino 101 Curie board. To get working I had to make a minor modification to the CurieImu.cpp file so I created a local copy as part of the FreeIMU library :).  Additional changes were made to the FreeIMU.h and FreeIMU.cpp files.  I added two example files to the CureIMU local library that I tested with the CurieIMU.  You will have to use the FreeIMU_cube processing sketch if you are using Processing 3.0 and above.  When I have time I will post a video.

01-20-16
Updated several libraries, FreeIMU.cpp/FreeIMU.h, etc to make compatible with Arduino IDE 1.6.7.  In addition, sketches should run on all boards except for Arduino 101 which will be hit or miss depending on the IMU configuration.  Still working on this.

Also, incorporated pull requests and bug fixes.

12-01-15
Replace LPS331 library by LPS libray for compatibility with ALTIMU10 v3 (LPS331AP) and AltIMU-10 v4 (LPS25H).
------- https://github.com/pololu/lps-arduino
------- Add support for the Dadafruit 10-DOF IMU (L3GD20H / LSM303 / BMP180).
------- Thanks to grezco for incorporating these changes.
Added additional code to Extended Kalman Filter example to work with Eigen without need to modify the Teensy board file.  Thanks to users over at Teensy forum

Renamed DebugUtils directory to FreeIMUUtils and moved CommunicationUtil.h and .cpp files to this directory.  This was done to allow FreeIMU and FreeIMU60XX to coexist without errors.

10-10-15

Added a FreeIMU60XX library.  This is essentially the same as the FreeIMU library tailored to fit on the Arduino Uno and supporting only the Invensese 6000, 6050, 9150 and the 9250 MPU.  It also now only supports the MS5611 pressure sensor.

Inorder to make it fit the temperature compensation and motion detection routines have been removed.

08-25-15 

Added 360 degree Euler angle rotation function. Also fixed an issue with val array out of bounds preventing correct angles being returned when angle functions are returned.

08-24-15 

Added support for the MS5637 Pressure Sensor using a slightly modified version of the Freetronics library.  All sketches were updated according.

07-24-15

Completed adding support for the LSM9DS0 iNemo IMU.  Made use of the Sparkfun LSM9DS0 library.  Thanks to the guys at Sparkfun, I owe you guys at SFE a few beers.  I did have to make a minor modification to the library to make it callable from the FreeIMU class. Based on initial tests its a pretty impressive little IMU. Staytuned for another video showing the stability of this little board.  

07-18-15

In verification of the Kalman code on a DFROBOT 10DOF IMU and with the Arduino Due as well as the Teensy 3.1 I found that I had to change the default values for Q and R with of the Extended Kalman Filter to work with both MPU6050 and DFROBOT IMUs.  Unfortunately I just can not tune the EKF for the DFROBOT IMU to get yaw from drifting uncontrollably.  Works great with the MPU6050.  In addition, found that while the tkjelectronics kalman sketch works with all boards the EKF version does not compile on the Teensy 3.1 without modification to the boards.txt linker options.  I can not find the issue that keeps it from compiling.  Appears to be a vararg issue. So if any enterprising person that can find the problem or comes up with better tuning values please let me know.

07-11-15
Made available two kalman filters for use with the FreeIMU library.  The first is the Kalman implementation by Kristian Lauszus, TKJ Eectronics, http://www.tkjelectronics.com, using his modified sketch that will compare the FreeIMU filter selected to that of the Kalman filter.  The Arduino sketch is FreeIMU_KalmanV1.ino.  The sketch requires the StandardCplusplus lib - please use the version on my github page as I had to make changes to it to work with the mega and other arduino boards per a issue description from the library.

The second implementaion uses the Kalman class from Picopter - Matthew Watson authored on Apr 29 2013, https://github.com/big5824/Picopter.git.  The sketch uses the ArduinoEigen Library and the stlport library which I hava also uploaded so please refresh your download.  The sketch for this implementation is FreeIMU_EKF2.  I also uploaded a processing sketch from Adafruit (Bunnyrotate.pde) for their AHRS implementation demo.  It uses the Saito object loader.  I did make a few modifications including getting rid of the bunny and use the Cassini model that comes with Saito library.  This I am also uploading.


03-25-15 
Incorporated DCM option based on the 9 Degree of Measurement Attitude and Heading Reference System for Sparkfun 9DOF Razor IMU (SEN-10125 and SEN-10736) and SparkFun 9DOF Sensor Stick (SEN-10183, SEN-10321 and SEN-10724), https://github.com/ptrbrtz/razor-9dof-ahrs.git.  The DCM, MATH and Razor_AHRS.ino files were combined into a DCM library for use with the FreeIMU library.

DCM implementation was based on the original code (http://code.google.com/p/sf9domahrs/) by Doug Weibel and Jose Julio, based on ArduIMU v1.5 by Jordi Munoz and William Premerlani, Jose Julio. Also used by ArduIMU and Minimu-9.

Additional functions added to get Euler angles directly from the DCM class as well as a function to convert the DCM matrix to quaternions which is used in the example sketch to interface with with existing Processing sketches.

An example file has been created to show the DCM implementation with euler angle output. Use existing Serial sketches for use with processing. No other changes are needed.

To use the DCM option set MARG = 4.  Remember that using a Magnetometer will give you better results than not when using this implementation of DCM.  It will work with a 6DOF but you may not have the best results.  You will also have to tune the proportional and integral gains for the IMU you select.  I have only tested and tuned the gains for the Microduio 10DOF IMU that I used to test the changes.

01-09-15
Updated xbee-arduino library to add new function: setAPImode(MODE). Where MODE would be set equal to 1 or 2 to correspond to the API mode that you selected for you Xbees.  Defaults to API Mode 2.

01-01-15
Merged pull request by Mauro Mombelli who fixed AHRS.h for readability and merged ARHSupdateIMU with AHRSupdate.  Updated FreeIMU.h accordingly.

11-28-14
Have incorporated the XBee-Arduino library by Andrew Rapp into an example sketch (FreeIMU_serial_ARM_CPU_XBEE.ino).  Did make a modification to it so that it would send packets without escapes.  So please use the one in the library folder otherwise it will not work.  Incorporated the Digi Xbee Java Library into the processing GUI (FreeIMU_cube_Odo_Exp_Digi2) in the Experimental folder.  This code has only been tested with the Mega with XBee 900HPs.

NOTE: To use the Xbee-Arduino with its examples skecthes you will need to edit the Xbee.h file and set ATAP=2 (Escpaes sent), currently set to ATAP=1 (No Escapes).

11-19-14
Combined running average filter and simple moving average filter into the AP_Filter library.

Added a capability to the Arduino serial sketch to load a permanent GPS config file from a attached I2C eeprom.  For my setup default baud is 57600. 

11-13-14
Added gyro_sensitivity as a variable to be defined in the sensors settings area of the FreeIMU.cpp file.

Re-worked code for defining sensor alignment so it is defined once in the FreeIMU.h file. Allows getQ_simple function to be used for all 9dof IMUs. Also simplies calling of AHRS functions. 

11-08-14
Fixed getQ_simple function to calculate quaternions correctly from yaw, pitch and roll. Modified the function so it can be used to improve convergence when IMU transitions from motion to zero motion.  Updated examples to include moving average filter. Serial sketch serial_ARM_cpu can be used universally and output motion detect to the v3 processing sketch in the experimental folder. Still have to make changes to a couple of the other sketches.

11-05-14
Thanks goes to duguyiqiu for pointing out that the Arduino Due Freq was not printing correctly. As a result I found that the legacy code did not address the I2C bus speed for the Due or the Mega 2560 to 400hz.  This is fixed with this update.

11-04-14
Minor update. Moved motion detect algorithm to FreeIMU library proper.  Created FreeIMU_cube_Odo_Exp_v3.pde to take motion detect from library.

10-25-14
Fixed severaly bugs that would cause the new AHRS filter to crash on compile. Jitting is still there and its a lot of fun watching the algorithm work with the default settings for the MPU9250.  Have fun tweaking the settings.

10-24-14
Implemented a third version of the Madgwick filter (Gradient Descent). This version is directly from his original paper.  Beta and Zeta have been left at their default values in the paper.

10-19-14
Several updates/corrections made to library: Fixed APM 2.5 axis alignment, deleted a 3g library that was not there, more tweaks to beta terms, uploaded missing TinyGPS++ library and moved Baudrate setting to beginning of sketches.

Incorporated MPL3115A2 pressure sensor support by Mario Cannistra (https://github.com/mariocannistra) as well as an example using a MPU-9250 using the MPL3115A2.


10-12-14 Updated library for support to APM 2.5 (Arduimu).  This change should also work on the APM 2.6 board as well.  MS5611 SPI library added from Ardupilot library (saved alot of time - thanks guys).  Put back iCompass module for aligned axis.  Had typo - now fixed so put it back in.

This SPI code for the MS5611 is based on the example sketch by JP B, "APM 2.6 and MPU6000 gyro - any custom firmware out there for this?" found at https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/diyrovers/thIohPCNyZA. Also see  http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?PHPSESSID=6mia4mslt5dalc1fi4ad8rl2g1&topic=125623.0


10-03-14 Updated FreeIMU.cpp to allow easier access to change accelerometer/gyro/magneter default range settings to match description in wiki page

09-22-14

Changed LSM303 library default sampling rate to 100hz for accel and magnetometer to adjust for use with Teensy 3.1

Updated (int) to (int16_t) in lps331 library for getTemperatureRaw.

FreeIMU examples updated accordingly based on compass averaging change.

09-20-14

Deleted iCompass and RunningAverage from FreeIMU. Compass averaging is done in the Processing sketch using Yarmartino compass averaging method which is more address issue of discontinuity at 0/360 degrees. Tests on the Altimu10 v3 are much more stable. The processing code was adapted from Christopher Baker's code at  https://github.com/SAIC-ATS/Algorithms.git. Will leave runningaveage library in case anyone wishes to use it for other reasons.

iCompass deleted as tilt compensation was not working properly. Tilt compensation is still done from within FreeIMU.cpp using a different method.

FreeIMU_serial.ino updated to reflect changes to implementation of altidue complimentary filter from within the library as opposed to calling from the serial sketch.

Remaining sketches are in the process of being updated.

09-12-14 - Updated tuning for Altimu10v3, MPU9250 breakout board from Innvense, and FreeIMUv0.4.3.

09-03-14 - As a result of a conversation with Dan Barzilay did a little more research and determined that using Seb Madgwicks MARG gradient descent filter would provide an improvement to the drifting that I was still seeing. Preliminary tests with the FreeIMU v4 board were promising as well as additional testing with several other boards.  As a result the MadgwickAHRS code was added to FreeIMU library directly from the X-IO website with some minor coding changes to allow you to select either or of the implementations.

Please consider this a better release as still have some additional testing to perform.

-----------------------------------------------------------

08-29-14 - incorporated changes proposed by Dan Barzilay which incorporates the Altitude Complimentary filter and the Heading calcs that was in the Procressing sketch directly into the library.

Arduino serial sketches were updated to output the heading and altimeter accordingly. As a result of the changes the Processing sketch was simplified and the changes incorporated into the FreeIMU_cube_Odo_Exp_v2 Gui in the experimental folder. 

Additional changes to the FreeIMU_cube_Odo Gui will be made shortly.

My thanks to Dan for incorporating these changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Uploaded processing version 2.0b7 which plays nicely with opengl to a separate library under mjs513.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

08-20-14 Added delay to processing sketch before serial read loop in set-up. Uploaded Processing 2.0b7 which works with the GUIs, no issue.

-----------------------------------------------------------

08-18-14 Reload of Freeimu.cpp, freeimu.h, calibration.h, freeimu_serial.ino and freeimu calib.  Tommasso report errors but I could not duplicate with my test versions so i am re uploading.

NOTE: With the advent of Processing 2.2 the GUI's do not seem to work anymore - issue with OPENGL. Will research and see if I can get operational again.
-----------------------------------------------------------

06-20-14
-------- Based on Kris Winer's work on the MPU-9250 and the AK8963 I was able to create a basic AK8963 library
